# ToDo Web Application
I want to create a web application for creating to-do lists, not just a simple to-do list I want to add features such as:
- calender sync
- Kanban Board
- Pomodoro (Timer)
- Sign in with Google Login
- Habit Tracker
- Adding to-do with date / time / priority / tags
- Filter System to view old and new tasks.
